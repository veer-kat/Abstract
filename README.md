FAQs 
 
Q. Why would i use Attention span improving mobile app when i can just dont use mobile and 
computer?  
A. There is a subtle different between improving attention span and distractions, mobile app 
and laptops are of course distractions but we are aiming to improve attention span while using 
those, for example you are a student who is studying through a books pdf on mobile because 
he could not find the physical copy or it is too expensive for him/her, but when studying on his 
mobile/tablet he can only focus for few mins say 10mins... we are claiming to improve this 
attention span through cognitive training. 

Q. Why would i use this app when there are plenty in the market (Playstore/Appstore)? 
A. We have gone through multiple apps in the market and founded out that none of them claims 
to improve attention span through cognitive training or using our novel techniques based on 
classic techniques just like Classic algorithms used in new machine learning algorithms. Rather 
they use menial features like app blockers or setting timers for users. 

Q. What is the USP (Unique selling point)? 
A.  We would provide Cognitive training with new twist of gamification of tasks with 
audio/visual distractions with the personalized timer and notivations of 
motivations(Notivations).
